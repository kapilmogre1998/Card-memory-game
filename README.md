# Memory Card Game

This is a simple Memory Card Game that tests your memory skills.

## Learning

During the development of this project:

1. **Code Splitting**: We implemented code-splitting techniques to optimize the loading of our application.

2. **Optimizing State Management**: Refactored the application to centralize state management, creating a single source of truth for data. This architectural change streamlined our codebase and made it more maintainable.

3. **Confetti Package Integration**: Installed and integrated the "Confetti" package to add a fun and celebratory visual effect when users win a game round.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Start the game with `npm run dev`.

## Usage
